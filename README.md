# Jellyfin for Samsung Smart TV with Orsay OS
This is a version of Jellyfin for Samsung Smart TV produced before 2014.
The models concerned are using Orsay OS, a legacy operating system that is no more supported.
Apps and OS updates are no more available but the system is still customizable using the developer account.

If your TV model is newer, it is probably using Tizen OS. 
In this case you should use this software: https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-tizen

# Supported Devices
Samsung TV's, Blu-ray Disk Players and Home Theatre Systems with older "Orsay" SmartHub operating system.
Specifically: D-Series (2011), E-Series (2012), F-Series (2013), H-Series (2014) plus some entry level J and K series models which still have Orsay.

The model ID can usually be found in the "Settings" menu, section "Support", "About"
You can refer to this article to understand the model naming:
